# basic-pokemon-game

You control a nature based "pokemon" which is far away from home and hungry.
As your pokemon likes bird meals you can try to catch some with your vertical vine attack.
You can move left and right.
Your major goal is surviving the obstacles and catching as many birds as possible. 

For sustain you have 3 lifes from the start.
Once you are hit by an obstacle you will loose one.

The game is over if you have lost all your lives or if you reach the 5 Minutes mark with at least one life left.
