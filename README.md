# Pokemon survival game

**About**
This game was inspired by a one time seen Pokemon game with similar mechanics.
(We intend to add features as we proceed.)

**Game description**
You control a nature based "pokemon" which is far away from home and hungry.
As your pokemon likes bird meals you can try to catch some with your vertical vine attack.
You can move the pokemon left and right.
Your major goal is surviving the obstacles and catching as many birds as possible. 

For sustain you have 3 lifes from the start.
Once you are hit by an obstacle you will loose one.

**Win condition**
The game is won once you have survived for 5 Minutes (at least one life left).

**Game Over **
The game is over if you have lost all your lives.
